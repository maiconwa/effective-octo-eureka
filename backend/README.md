# crispy-eureka

This is not a stand alone app. It's a blog app and blog API developed to be consumed by a front end React Native project.

If what you want is to see the back-end, all of it is on this project.

In order to run the back-end properly you need to create a secret key and pass it to settings.py SECRET_KEY, create a virtual enviroment using python3 -m venv venv command, install tkinter with sudo apt-get install python3-tk, install requirements.txt using pip, with pip install -r requirements.txt.

If what you are looking is the React Native counterpart of this software, please follow the link below.
